    <p class="head-text">Hi, my name is Kate. I'm  a Ukrainian student who study <i>html/css/js</i>.
      This page is made for practicing and improving my skills. Here I will post 
      games (made by this company) which I played, and little explanation of why
      they are important for me.

        <p><span>Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection</span> was the first game I have bought
       for my PS4. And all of three games were one of my best expirience ever.
       I got 100% in every part and that's were my love for linear third-person 
       games with platformer and puzzle elements started.</p>

      </div>

    <section id="2" class="section">
      <img src="Pics/Tlou1.jpg" alt="TLOU1 picture" >
      <div class="game_text second">
        <p><span>The last of us 1</span>. This game one of my favourite and most re-played game.
        Tlou 1 made me love survival games, and that's where I understand that stealth is the
      type of playing I love the most.</p>

    <section id="3" class="section">
      <img src="Pics/Uncharted4.jpg" alt="Uncharted4 picture">
      <div class="game_text third">
        <p><span>Uncharted 4: Thief`s end</span> was a perfect ending of Uncharted series.
        I love that Naugthy Dog made it more beutiful, locations became bigger, and controls
      became comfortable, plus new features that made it possible to play stealth.</p>

    <section id="4" class="section">
      <img src="Pics/Tlou2.jpg" alt="TLOU2 picture">
      <div class="game_text fourth">
        <p><span>The last of us 2</span>. Just like Uncharted 4 this game have bigger locations,
        new features and looks even more beutiful. I love that just like in first part,
        we cane play 2 characters with different type of weapon. I hope that in future there would
      be a DLC so I can play more.</p>
